# Discriminant and Nature of Roots
### Our aim is to develop system which finds the discriminant of the quadratic equation and finds its nature.
---
## Discriminant
<p> The discriminant of a polynomial is a quantity that depends on the coefficients and determines various properties of the roots. The discriminant of a polynomial is generally defined in terms of a polynomial function of its coefficients. </p>

---

## Nature of Roots
<p>The discriminant determines the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation. The word 'nature' refers to the types of numbers the roots can be â€” namely real, rational, irrational or imaginary.</p>
